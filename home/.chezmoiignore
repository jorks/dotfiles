# OS-SPECIFIC SCRIPT EXECUTION
# =====================================================================
# Scripts in .chezmoiscripts/ are controlled by in-script OS checks,
# NOT by .chezmoiignore patterns. Each script checks the OS at runtime
# and exits early if not appropriate. See individual script headers
# for details on their platform requirements.
# =====================================================================

# Exclude example / reference files
